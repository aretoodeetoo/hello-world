# hello-world
aretoodeetoo's first repository; don't mind me, just learning to code

I like to travel, eat food, drink coffee, and solve problems. I like coding more every day, and have more self-doubts about it every night. But I have decided that it's better to face the fear than to settle in stagnancy, so I'm going to work as hard as I can and crush this journey!

Life motto? Somewhere between "hakuna matata" and "die living" on any given day. Also, "There is a time and a place for decaf coffee; never, and in the trash." 

Favorite books? Harry Potter, anything by Oscar Wilde, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Discipline of Grace.
Favorite movies? Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, the Bourne Trilogy, anything that's funny. 
Favorite music? I frickin love the Killers! Any other playlist depends on the day, the task at hand, and my mood.
Favorite places? New Orleans, which is home; I love my family! Paris; I can never get enough. Louisville; the home I made for myself. San Diego; I like to eat my weight in burritos at least once a year, and there's no place better to do it than San Diego.
